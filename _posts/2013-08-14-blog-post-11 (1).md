🎉 New Year Resolution? Let’s Go! 🐎
Today, on the 2nd day of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, instead of looking back on 2025, I’m choosing to reflect on what I should commit to for the cheerful year ahead 💫.

It’s been 2 months since I started working as an IT consultant for a lab. That means a lot more time on the computer, and some weeks working entirely from home 🏠💻. 

Compared to my time at Lactalis—where being on-site 4/5 days a week was mandatory—it’s a huge shift :
I almost no longer feel that sense of company loyalty, since I’ll be working for several clients instead of being an internal employee.
Working more from home also means… less cycling 🚴‍♀️💨 (I used to bike to the Lactalis office every day!). And definitely less human contact 😅. At Lactalis, I had a bunch of semi-colleagues who were super young, dynamic, and always down for weekend hangouts.

So what to head for in 2026?  🚀✨
- 🏋️‍♀️ At least 15 minutes of home exercise, 4 days per week on average (or 3 if life gets crazy).
  
- ✍️ Write on my lovely blog at least once per month — even a tiny post if I’m busy or stressed.
  
- 🎣 Try 1 new hobby: I just bought a fishing rod… haha let’s see if I catch anything LOL.
  
- 🎨 Invest in my current hobby — drawing: explore new materials like watercolor for urban sketching, try fude water pens, masking liquid, etc.

- 📚 Read books again, preferably before bed, and reduce social media time.

- 📖 Keep learning French and get a B2 certificate by the end of the year. Would be so nice for paperwork and professional advance (even though I already work 100% in French).
  
- 😅 Get some admin done. Finger crossed hahha

- 💆‍♀️ Take care of myself: exfoliate every 2–3 weeks, daily skincare with active ingredients.

- 🍜 Food discovery - my lifetime passion: try a new restaurant or cook a new recipe at least once per month.

- ❤️ Nourish family bonding and relationships.
  
Any other recommendations? Ib me please 😌

Yes, this post is all about my personal objectives, but through this, I hope to motivate you to gear up and try new things in the upcoming Year of the Horse 🐎✨. A year of heading up and moving forward — but let’s not forget to slow down when needed 🌿.
