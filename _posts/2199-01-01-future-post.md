I spent 8 months in France, and 5 of those months were up in the mountains :))) 
Just kidding, but actually, the 3 cities I stayed in for a few months are all in the Auvergne-RhÃ´ne-Alpes region, nestled among the slopes of the Alps, the rooftop of Europe. 

Mountains - the natural boundary protecting craftsmanship
------
Mountains act like perfect natural walls preserving the unique traits of each territory (this is also easy to see in Vietnamâ€™s history/geography, where geographic barriers create distinct climate, cuisine, lifestyle, and even political differences between North and South).

Itâ€™s the same in France â€” the mountain region of Auvergne-RhÃ´ne-Alpes holds many regional cultural gems and long-standing traditional crafts: many local languages still preserved like Le Bourbonnais, Le Croissant, Lâ€™occitan; glove-making shops in Grenoble that keep alive the traditional craft whose products were coveted by kings and nobles across five continents. The biggest highlights here are the countless mountain sports centers in Chamonix and Grenoble and the natural reserve in ArdÃ¨che.

ðŸ‘‰ A centuries-old mountain cuisine
------
Like its people, the local food is deeply influenced by the climate and terrain. After 3 months studying and nearly 3 months working here, I really feel the difference in character compared to Northern regions like Paris or Angers. People here are simple and friendly, mostly living in harmony with nature through agriculture and livestock farming. 

They produce charcuterie (salted meats, traditional sausages) like foie gras (fatty goose liver) and rotisserie-style meats from Lyon; cheeses with Protected Geographical Indications that make dishes like La fondue savoyarde (the famous cheese fondue) and Gratin Dauphinois â€” always at the top of any must-try list in France.

ðŸ‘‰ Influences from Italian and Swiss cuisine
-----
Thanks to its geography, the Auvergne-RhÃ´ne-Alpes culinary style carries influences from snowy mountain cuisine and Mediterranean flavors. The hills provide abundant milk and meat from naturally grazed sheep, cattle, and pigs; the mountain climate is perfect for aging cheese, cured pork, and wine over many months. 

On the other hand, the Mediterranean side brings olives, vegetables, and some fish varieties (though not very common). And being close to Italy, Ravioli (pasta stuffed with cheese) is very popular here.

Worth mentioning: France and Italy have a friendly rivalry over the origins of many dishes. These two top European cuisines always compete fiercely for rankings, so donâ€™t be surprised if you hear locals throwing some shade at the other! :)))

But honestly, I think European cuisine diversity still canâ€™t beat Vietnam, so now Iâ€™m adding a trip to Vietnam on my bucket list for food adventures ðŸ¤ª
