Series: What can foods tell u about? - ABOUT HISTORY. Meaty dishes led me on a Flavorful Journey Through Romanian Cuisine, History, and Hidden Legacies

A culinary art inherited from the medieval empires
------
I'm more in love with Romanian food than anything else ‚Äî more than Italy‚Äôs pasta and tomato-sauce-drenched pizzas, or France‚Äôs 1001 types of cheese paired with wine, each bursting with distinct regional flair. The flavors here are diverse, rich, and deeply rooted in a culinary tradition shaped over tens of thousands of years. It‚Äôs a beautiful blend ‚Äî a careful selection and adaptation of the gastronomic gems from the most powerful medieval empires of Europe (Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Greece, Russia, France, Italy), layered over local Orthodox religious practices and even foreign religions like Islam and Catholicism.

Meats
------
Romanians love their meat, especially pork. Like the dish ‚ÄúSarmale‚Äù (pickled cabbage rolls stuffed with meat) that my homeroom teacher once made for us (photo). Or those kebab rolls I often grabbed on the go when I was late to class üòä)).

"you need to learn how to make a good Sarmale to find a wife husband in Romania" My prof said :)))

Sarmale - the national food of Romania

Turk infuences
------
These meaty dishes were born under the influence of the Turks ‚Äî the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim empire that spanned from the 14th century until after World War I. The Romanian people rose up many times against the Ottomans' tax-based rule but never succeeded.
