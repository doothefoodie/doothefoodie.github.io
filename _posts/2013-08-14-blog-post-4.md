Just a random scattered thought

Spent almost a year in France, studying a Food program designed by the Frenchâ€”gave my French teachers quite a run for their moneyâ€”but havenâ€™t managed to write a single post about French cuisine, one of the worldâ€™s top-ranked culinary traditions. Honestly, feeling a bit embarrassed ðŸ¤£

Mostly because my own menu is a bitâ€¦ unconventional like this ðŸ¤­:

- rice mixed with jambon dipped in fish sauce
- croissant stuffed with lettuce and foie gras dipped in fish sauce
- potatoes in fresh cream sauce drizzled with soy sauce
etc

... so yeah, I just post silly stuff like this from time to time instead of writing anything serious...
