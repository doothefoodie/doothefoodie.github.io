Series: What can foods tell u about? - about history 
In my 3rd semester in Romania, Meaty dishes led me on a Flavorful Journey Through Romanian Cuisine, History, and Hidden Legacies

A culinary art inherited from the medieval empires
------
I'm more in love with Romanian food than anything else — more than Italy’s pasta and tomato-sauce-drenched pizzas, or France’s 1001 types of cheese paired with wine, each bursting with distinct regional flair. The flavors here are diverse, rich, and deeply rooted in a culinary tradition shaped over tens of thousands of years. It’s a beautiful blend — a careful selection and adaptation of the gastronomic gems from the most powerful medieval empires of Europe (Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Greece, Russia, France, Italy), layered over local Orthodox religious practices and even foreign religions like Islam and Catholicism.

Meats
------
Romanians love their meat, especially pork. Like the dish “Sarmale” (pickled cabbage rolls stuffed with meat) that my homeroom teacher once made for us (photo). Or those kebab rolls I often grabbed on the go when I was late to class 😊)).

"you need to learn how to make a good Sarmale to find a wife husband in Romania" My prof said :)))

Turk infuences
------
These meaty dishes were born under the influence of the Turks — the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim empire that spanned from the 14th century until after World War I. The Romanian people rose up many times against the Ottomans' tax-based rule but never succeeded. 

The old map of Romania was divided into 3 states and one of them shares the border with the Ottoman Empire
The territory nowadays includes some extra parts, making it looks like a 🐠

Vlad - the Dracular!
------
The most iconic figure of resistance was none other than Vlad Țepeș the Impaler — the Dracula of legend. Vlad led troops into Ottoman lands and impaled tens of thousands of people in the most brutal way possible (impaling was Vlad’s signature execution method, where a stake was driven from the mouth down through the anus). Unsurprisingly, Vlad’s army was no match for the Ottomans — one of the most influential empires in history. It’s said that even while imprisoned, just before the Sultan ordered his execution, Vlad was still impaling rats in his cell 😖.

Surprise
------
What surprised me was that, despite centuries of Ottoman rule, I didn’t come across a single mosque in Romania. Turns out, to preserve some autonomy and avoid religious imposition, Romania paid massive tribute taxes to the Ottomans. As a result, even though the country is rich in natural resources like gold, salt, and fertile land, its capital city couldn't develop properly. A lot of my classmates weren’t even interested in visiting Bucharest… “because it’s ugly” :))) That “ugliness” is, of course, the product of many other factors — like a series of fires back when buildings were mostly made of wood, a devastating earthquake in 1977, and more recently, the wave of Communism that swept through after World War II (note: Romania was never part of the Soviet Union; it was just a Communist country, like Poland, Hungary, or Yugoslavia at the time).

This is getting long so I’ll stop here for now — hopefully I’ll be disciplined enough to write the next part 😆
