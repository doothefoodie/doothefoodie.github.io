Momo - my spicy love affair
------
Amidst the food paradise garnished with spices, I choose momo almost every day. It's a Nepali dumpling typicality filled with buffalo, chicken or vegetables in a wheat coating (having Hinduism as the mainstream religion, people here dont eat beef, but buffalo yesss). Momo is served everywhere in Nepal for snack or main meal with different varieties and cooking method: steaming, stewing, frying.

Although people eat by hand most of the foods, fork is useful to dip momo into spicy sauces. But for me, it‚Äôs better to use chopstick  and "soak" the whole momo into the sauce added with extra chili and garlic, just like the way we dip all kind of foods with fish sauce in Vietnam :)))

Momo resembles "Dumpling"- then it must be originated from China?
------
Not really, there are 2 theories:
Some source stated that Momo was initially from Nepal, in the land of Newari people that become the capital city Katmandu nowsaday. Afterwards, it was introduced to Tibet, China and as far away as Japan by a Nepalese princess who was married to a Tibetan king in the late fifteenth century.
Another source believe that Momo was taken by the Newar merchants from Tibet, China where they used to go trade, and then became popular among their community. 

Anyway, the origin of momo engages with Newari people, so who are they and what's special about them?

Unlike other common-origin groups in Nepal, the Newars has a relict identity. They are the historical inhabitants of Nepal and the creators of its historic heritage and civilisation associated with Hinduism and Buddhism. The Newar kingdom reside in Katmandu for thousand years,  until the conquest of the valley by the Gorkha Kingdom in 1769.

The Newari - the very first indigenous people in Nepal (and among those in Asia as well)

The Newars are traditionally noticed as architect and artisants. Since the medival time, painting, scuptures, potteries, handicrafts flourished throughout the region. For architecture, the Newari built 3 Durbar square (royal palaces) for the 3 Newari kingdoms that exists in Nepal in the 1600s.The area consists of temples, shrines, open courts that are tiled with red bricks and dedicated for Hinduism and Buddhism.They were all recognized as the cultural heritage by UNESCO.

From the early 20th century until democratization, Newar suffered from official suppression. Also, due to influx of people from both north (Tibet- China) and south (Tirhut - India), genetic races of came to Nepal and greatly moulded the dominant culture and tradition of Newar‚Äôs. Today the language has been listed as being "definitely endangered" by UNESCO.

After 2 weeks here, I‚Äôd say that Nepal is the most unique and well-preserved culture that I have been visited so far. And Newari rituals, customs and cuisine are vividly highlighted on the daily activities of the locals in Katmandu, their homeland after thousand years!üåû
