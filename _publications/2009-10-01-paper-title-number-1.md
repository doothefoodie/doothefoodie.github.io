For the first time ever, delightful Asian herbs and spices are entwined with French traditional know-how, creating a unique degusting experience. The tangy lemongrass, aromatic pepper, spicy chili, and a note of Vietnamese Pho (anis and cinnamon). The new flavor profiles are sure to impress even the most discerning taste buds 

I was in charge of the full product development: formulation, pilot trials, package design, market and pricing benchmarking."
Result: Successfully launched these products in Vietnam, China, and Singapore, and recently Canada.
