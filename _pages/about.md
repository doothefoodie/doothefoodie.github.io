About me
------
I’m a passionate foodie who looooves eating and exploring food through every lens: not only the flavor delights but also the traditional, cultural and historical roots behind each dish.

My food journey truly began in 2021, when I landed in 5 EU countries thanks to a fully-funded scholarship from the European Commission to pursue a Master’s degree in Food Science.

Along my trainings, I discovered a love for digital technologies and gradually pivoted toward IT — one of my favorite side projects being the creation of this very website!

Today, I work at the intersection of food and technology, driven by an ambition to help empower the food industry through digital solutions.

Afterwork, I love spending time in the nature 🌳🌴 urban drawing, cycling, wandering, swimming and recently learning kayak
