About me
------
🍜 I’m a passionate foodie who looooves eating and exploring food through every lens: not only the flavor delights but also the traditional, cultural and historical roots behind each dish. Since my student days, I’ve been traveling extensively to experience local cuisines and immerse myself in diverse cultures. 👉 How did I afford all that travel as a student? - by scholarship-hunting and exchange programs abroad!

👩‍🎓 My food journey took a major turn in 2021, when I landed in Europe thanks to a fully-funded scholarship from the European Commission to pursue a Master’s degree in Food Science in 5 EU countries.

💻 Along the way, I discovered a love for digital technologies and gradually pivoted toward IT. I taught myself new skills like SQL and Groovy, and worked on projects involving IoT and blockchain. 👉 One of the projects I’m proud of? - The creation of this very website! 😊

🔬🌐 Today, I work in the intersection of FOOD SCIENCE and DIGITAL TECH in France, with digital solutions like Block chain, MES, LIMS, etc.

🌳 Afterwork, I love spending time in the nature : urban drawing 🖌📸, cycling 🚴‍♂️, wandering🚶‍♀️, swimming 🏊 and learning kayak 🚣‍♀️.
